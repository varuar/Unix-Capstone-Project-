# What can and does your program do?
My program allows users to interact with a patient management system through a command line interface. The options available to the user are to list all patients, add a new patient, search for a patient based on their last name, or delete a patient based on their last name. The program stores patient records in a CSV file and assigns each patient a unique ID based on their first and last name. When listing or searching for patients, the program displays their full name, phone number and ID.

# Are there any issues with your program?
I did not notice any major issues with my program.

# Are there any additional features that you added to your app? (optional, not mandatory)
I mean there is always much more you can do like add more functionality to the program, I could consider adding features such as editing patient records, generating reports on patient demographics or medical history, or integrating with a database management system.
